# Code of Conduct
Like many projects on GitHub, pronoundb.org defines a code of conduct and enforces it to ensure a safe and welcoming
community.

## Rules
 - **Be welcoming and friendly**<br>
   I will not tolerate aggressive behavior, and expect everyone to behave in a friendly and civil manner.

 - **\*-phobia is strictly prohibited**<br>
   Any form of such behavior will be moderated immediately and the evildoers will be restricted from interacting with
   the repository. This applies to *any* form of hateful behavior towards a specific group of people.

 - **Respect people views and opinions**<br>
   Even if you disagree, you can still disagree in a respectful manner and argue in a calm and constructed way. People
   are way more likely to listen to you, and even agree in some cases! Incredible what calm discussions can do these
   days.

 - **Any form of extremism is not allowed**<br>
   Extremism is dangerous and only lead to conflicts, and nobody likes conflicts. Exaggerating someone's view on a
   subject to misleadingly claim they are being offensive, oppressive, or otherwise harmful falls under this rule.

You may report unappropriated behavior by shooting me an email at cynthia@maid.gg.
