# Hacking
This document serves as a description of how PronounDB works internally, to help contributors who wish to add new
platforms, fix bugs, or dig into the source code in general.

## General structure
PronounDB is entirely written in TypeScript, with a small limited amount of JavaScript for shared components (to
avoid annoying compilation overhead when the benefits are small enough).

The repository is a monorepo which contains 2 packages (+ various configuration files):
  - `packages/extension`: Browser extension
  - `packages/website`: Website source code

This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management and general management. You will most likely run into
troubles if you try to use another package manager.

### Development environment
You can start services needed for PronounDB with with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Once services
are up, you can run the dev server with `pnpm run dev` in the websites package.

To test the extension, you can run `pnpm run dev` in the extension package to build the extension & enable automatic
re-building when files are changed. You'll need to load the extension in your browser manually, and to refresh it
manually every time in the browser.

### Building for production
The website and extension can all be built using `pnpm run build`.

The extension will additionally be packed for submission on extension stores, and the following files will be produced:
  - An archive for Chromium-based browsers
  - An archive for Firefox-based browsers
  - An archive of the source code with notes for reviewers (used to submit to the Mozilla Add-Ons team)

### Testing & linting
Code styling is enforced using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and you can run the linter using `pnpm run lint`.

The extension can be tested end-to-end using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) by using `pnpm run test` in the
extension package. E2E tests do not require the API to be running; test data is provided via API mocks. **You need
to build the extension with `pnpm run build` before running the tests**.

See the [test accounts](#test-accounts) section for more details about how to E2E test an app with a test account.

## Building a new integration
### Add info about the integration
The first step is to create a file in `packages/website/src/components/platform` with the name, color and icon of the
integration. This will make it show up as supported on the website.

### Setup the OAuth flow
This step is very simple and requires very little amount of work, thanks to OAuth being a well-implemented standard.
You simply need to:
  - Add the client id/secret pair placeholder in `packages/website/.env.example`
  - Create a new file for your platform in `packages/website/src/server/oauth/platforms`.
    - Here is an example of an [OAuth 2.0 config](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb.org/blob/b2e47cb/packages/website/src/server/oauth/platforms/discord.ts)
    - Here is an example of an [OAuth 1.0a config](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb.org/blob/b2e47cb/packages/website/src/server/oauth/platforms/twitter.ts)

And voil√†! The OAuth flow should be working like a charm. It'll be automatically picked up by the API and the login,
register and link pages.

### Build the extension integration
This is by far the most time-consuming part of making a new integration. To get started, you need to create a new file
in `packages/extension/src/modules`, which needs to export a few things.

- `name`: Platform name.
- `color`: Platform color.
- `match`: RegExp which will be tested against pages paths to know when a module should run.
- `Icon`: Platform icon as a component. Can use the `export { default as Icon } from 'simple-icons/...'` pattern.
- `inject`: Entry point of your module. Will be called on all pages where your module's `match` did match.

You can look at how other modules are built to get some insight in how things should be done, and how they're done.

You'll also need to add the necessary permissions in `packages/extension/build/manifest.ts`.

#### Utility methods
*TODO*: Document React prop fetcher, DOM helpers (`h`, `css`)

#### Settings
*TBD*

### Test the integration
**Note**: Extension E2E tests are very WIP, and not fully finished yet. The goal is to have all modules tested and run
tests periodically using GitHub Actions. Right now, GitHub Actions aren't configured.

To ensure continuous testing and detection when a website update breaks one of the modules, it's best to test the
extension. Tests are run using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and you can take a look at how other modules
are tested to get some inspiration.

#### Test accounts
*TBD*
